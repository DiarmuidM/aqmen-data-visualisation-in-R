<h1 align="center">Data Visualisation</h1>

<h3 align="center">R Workshop (March 2019)</h3>

<h3 align="center">A three day hands-on workshop led by Dr Diarmuid McDonnell and Professor Vernon Gayle, University of Edinburgh.</h3>

<br>

### Topics: 

Visualising data is emerging as a key component in effectively communicating research results and evidence. This three-day workshop will provide a comprehensive introduction for individuals wishing to learn how to design, produce and interpret data visualisations.

Topics covered include:
* Guiding principles for constructing effective data visualisations
* Getting data in shape for visualising
* How to graph quantitative data using the ggplot2 package in R
* Graphing a range of variables and data types (e.g. numeric and categorical values, associations)
* Graphing the results of statistical models
* Refining graphical presentations
* Practical hands-on sessions introducing the methods and techniques outlined above.

The workshop would benefit any individual, whether in academia or industry, looking to become proficient in data visualisation using R as rapidly and painlessly as possible. Good general knowledge of statistcal methods and data analysis would be an advantage but not a necessity, as would some experience of working with data in an academic or industrial setting (e.g. social surveys, organisational data).

### Rationale: 

The Industrial Strategy recognises that a major challenge facing UK businesses and industry is how best to utilise big data to improve economic performance and increase productivity. A substantial barrier to exploiting the potential offered by emerging forms of big data is the lack of a suitably trained workforce with appropriate analytical skills. Many statistical techniques used in the social sciences are also suitable for the analysis of big data in non-academic settings, however social science graduates often lack experience in applying their skills and knowledge in non-academic research domains.
