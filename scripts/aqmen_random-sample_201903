char_fin <- read_csv("./data_raw/extract_financial.csv")
head(char_fin)

# This is quite a large file that has proven problematic for producing graphs.
# Caspar's clever solution is to create a smaller data set by randomly sampling the original data:

char_fin_subset <- char_fin[sample(nrow(char_fin), 100000), ] # draw a random sample of 100,000 observations
nrow(char_fin_subset) # ta dah, a small random sample of the original data set
